# Caspio Data Page Processor

## Overview
The Caspio Data Page Processor is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of retrieving and processing data from Caspio datapages. It efficiently interacts with the Caspio database using both REST API calls and web scraping techniques, ultimately saving the extracted data to Excel and CSV files. 

## Features
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Securely connects to Caspio using OAuth for API requests.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetches a list of datapages and their detailed information from Caspio.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes Selenium for extracting additional datapage details not available via the API.
- **Data Filtering**: Identifies and excludes already processed datapages to optimize performance.
- **Error Logging**: Captures and logs errors during datapage processing for review and troubleshooting.
- **Data Export**: Saves processed datapage information in both Excel and CSV formats.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium WebDriver
- Pandas
- Openpyxl (for Excel file handling)
- Requests
- Tqdm (for progress bar functionality)
- A valid Caspio account with necessary access rights

## Installation
```bash
pip install selenium pandas openpyxl requests tqdm
```

## Usage
- Update the CaspioAPI class with your Caspio client credentials (client_id and client_secret).
- Create an instance of CaspioDataPageProcessor with your Caspio account email, password, and the specific application name:
```bash
processor = CaspioDataPageProcessor("your_email@example.com", "your_password", "your_app_name")
```
- Call the run method to start the data processing:
```bash
processor.run()
```
```bash
processor.save_to_excel()
processor.save_to_csv()
processor.write_errors_to_file()
```
